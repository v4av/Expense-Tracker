Project: Expense Tracker

Problem

I always spend too much money and I don't know where it goes. Writing on paper is hard because I lose the paper.

Solution

I made a website called Expense Tracker.
It helps me:

Log my expenses.

See my total money.

See where I spent the most.

Who uses this?

People like students who have limited money.

Tech

I used React and Firebase.
