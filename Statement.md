Project Statement: Expense Tracker

1. Problem Statement

Managing pocket money or a monthly salary is difficult. I often find myself spending money on small things like snacks or travel and then wondering where my money went by the end of the month. Writing expenses in a notebook is inconvenient because I sometimes forget the notebook, and using complex Excel sheets on a mobile phone is frustrating. I needed a simple, accessible way to track my daily spending.

2. Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is to build a personal web-based application that allows a single user to:

Log In: Access a private dashboard using a simple username.

Record Transactions: Log both income (money received) and expenses (money spent).

Visualize Data: See a real-time calculation of the remaining balance and a breakdown of spending categories.

Data Persistence: Save data to the cloud so it is not lost when the browser is closed.

3. Target Users

Students: To manage monthly allowances.

Beginners: People who are new to financial tracking and want a simple tool without complex banking integration.

4. High-Level Features

Anonymous Authentication (Login by name).

Add Income/Expense functionality.

Dashboard with Balance, Total Income, and Total Expense cards.

Transaction History list with Delete option.

Simple Bar Chart for category analysis.
